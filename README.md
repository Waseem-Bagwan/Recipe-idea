🧩 Project Overview

Book Finder is a modern React web application that allows users to search for books, view detailed information, and create a personalized collection.
It was built for Alex, a college student who wants an easy way to discover and save books using the Open Library API.

🧠 How I Used AI (ChatGPT)

Recruiters asked how I leverage AI — here’s my genuine workflow:
Idea Structuring: I asked ChatGPT to help break down the problem from user persona → feature list → data flow.
UI Guidance: ChatGPT helped me design a clean layout (Home, Book Details, Collection) and guided on component separation.
API Debugging: When the Open Library JSON responses were inconsistent, ChatGPT explained key formats and edge-case handling.
Code Review: I refined my useEffect logic and context state management after AI suggestions for cleaner patterns.
Styling Polish: ChatGPT helped modernize my Tailwind design to match a real-world book discovery app look.
I used AI as a collaborator, not a crutch — generating design direction, architecture clarity, and speed.
