🍳 Recipe Ideas — README.md
🧩 Project Overview

Recipe Ideas is a visually rich and responsive web app built for Taylor, a busy professional who wants to cook based on available ingredients.
It uses TheMealDB API to fetch meals dynamically — just type the ingredients you have, and the app instantly shows you recipes that match.

The goal was to create a simple but modern recipe discovery experience with features like favorites, ingredient search, and detailed meal popups.

👩‍💻 User Need
“After work, I often have random ingredients and limited time. I want a tool that helps me find easy recipes using what I already have.”

🎨 Features

🧂 Search meals by ingredient using TheMealDB API
🍲 Display responsive grid of meals with images, names, and quick access
🔍 View detailed recipe instructions and ingredients
❤️ Save favorite meals to localStorage (persistent between sessions)
⚙️ Handles no results, loading states, and image placeholders
💨 Lazy-loaded and optimized for fast performance

🧠 How I Used AI (ChatGPT)

Here’s how I used AI intelligently and professionally throughout development:
Requirement Interpretation: ChatGPT helped me translate the user persona into actionable UI components — search bar, grid layout, and recipe detail modal.
API Exploration: It helped me understand how TheMealDB’s endpoints work (filter.php?i={ingredient} and lookup.php?i={id}) and structure my fetch logic.
UI Guidance: I collaborated with ChatGPT to make the UI feel real — improving grid spacing, image transitions, and hover effects for modern appeal.
Performance Fixes: When image loading slowed the app, ChatGPT suggested lazy loading and blur-up placeholders, which dramatically improved UX.
Code Architecture: I discussed state management and routing patterns with AI to keep the code clean and reusable across pages.
This collaboration shows problem-solving maturity — using AI to learn, debug, and enhance design — not just to “generate code.”
